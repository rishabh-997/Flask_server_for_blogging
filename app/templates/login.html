<!--The novalidate attribute is used to tell the web browser to not apply validation to the fields in this form,
which effectively leaves this task to the Flask application running in the server -->

<!-- The form.hidden_tag() template argument generates a hidden field that includes a token that is used to protect the form against CSRF attacks.
All you need to do to have the form protected is include this hidden field and have the SECRET_KEY variable defined in the Flask configuration.
If you take care of these two things, Flask-WTF does the rest for you. -->
